        <p>We all have been there, looking for a place to stay, in a city that we are strangers to.
            Our team wanted the juniors that followed us to have an easier time finding a place to 
            stay, and as a result 'Board in Ruhuna' project was started.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A catalog of boarding places</li>
            <li>Contact information of the landlords</li>
            <li>Information about capacity and availability</li>
            <li>Clear description of amenities</li>
            <li>Pictures for remote inspection</li>
            <li>Maintained by the students for the students</li>
            <li>This gives some power back to the students from landlords</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All provided to you through 'Board in Ruhuna' for your convinience. If you are a student
            of <a href="https://www.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/en/"> the University of Ruhuna</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ucmatara/"> University College of Matara</a>, or 
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Technical-College-Matara-100046609405637/">Technical College

            this catalog will help you in your search for a place to board.

        <h4>Plan</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Decouple ownership of the rooms from submission of the rooms for the catalog. This way 
                students can submit their rooms to the catalog. Then the landlords can take owndership 
                of the rooms, once they have created an account.</li>
            <li>User verification using phone numbers, sms and other verification methods that do not 
                require landlords to remember their passwords</li>
        </ul>
